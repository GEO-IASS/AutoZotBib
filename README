AutoZotBib is an extension for Zotero which will automatically export your Zotero library to a BibTeX
file every time the library is changed.

More information, and documentation, is available at www.rtwilson.com/academic/autozotbib

*Updates:*
- *v0.6* - Added option to turn off automatic exporting and click a menu item to export the BibTeX file (thanks @bjonnh!)
- *v0.5* - First major release of AutoZotBib
